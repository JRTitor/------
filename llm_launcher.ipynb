      "I'd never buy individual slices, but if one were available in an affordable size (and my local grocery store doesn't carry this), then maybe $4-$5/piece could go toward meals at restaurants or something else. That seems reasonable enough given what we already paid there anyway. The only thing missing from their listings on Yelp might be some sorta \"deliciousness\" testimonials as well--but even those aren't very likely either since many places just say things about taste without actually testing out anything with regards to quality etc.. It also looks weird when your favorite restaurant uses different names throughout its reviews: Isolina in New York City; Bella Italia NYC; Fat Daddy Pizzeria; Momofuku Seiobo - though these are all good-luck restaurans which don'e sell stuff online.

We wanted a simple, uncomplicated meal‚Äîthe kind of thing your mother would cook when she got home from work after taking care of children or something like this. It could be an appetizer with cheese dip on top followed by fried chicken wings (which my mom always made). The only things missing are some slices of pepperoni breaded up in garlic sauce to serve as dipping accompaniment if you so choose. And then there's stuffed shellfish: cuttlebone fish fillets; calamari steamed atop hot-pink prawn noodles with crunchy green mashed potato pieces; squid gnocchetti served over rice paper strips filled with roasted tomatoes. This all sounds great because these aren't just any old dishes! There is really nothing wrong about them other than their blandness. In fact they almost resemble ordinary plates without much flavor difference but maybe better yet have less taste bud appeal too? They do contain ingredients whose use might raise ecological concerns even though most people who order takeaway seem to think otherwise. That being said, our waiter told us \"they will never become popular\" which may make sense given how many times he makes mentioning food waste before every single course here nowadays while trying not show interest during discussions around ethics regarding environmental conservation. He also seemed quite surprised by the lack of vegetarian options available since his wife usually orders veggies whenever possible whereas her husband prefers seafoods and salads more often. So yeah, although those pesky bugs still exist outrightly thanks to humans' greedy lust towards convenience items rather than proper consideration of environmentally friendly production practices, why bother making such sacrifices anymore anyway right?\n",
